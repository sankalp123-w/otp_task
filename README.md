# OTP_TASK IN REACTJS AS FRONT END AND NODE JS AS BACKEND 

## first go to frontend folder 
### do `npm install` will install all dependencies 

## now run `npm start` to run the frontend

## Now go to backend folder 
### do `npm install` will install all dependencies 
### change .env.example to .env  and enter your details 

## note - sending sms to phone code is commented as it takes money to send msg to phones bt using twillio

### now run `nodemon server` to run the backend 

## you can also test backend api in api.rest file .

Thanks
